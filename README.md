# ðŸ§  AI vs Human Hate Speech Detection in Indic Languages

This repository contains the code, datasets, and trained models for our two-stage hate speech moderation pipeline. We detect toxic content and identify its originâ€”whether it was generated by a human or by AI (e.g., GPT, BlenderBot)â€”with a focus on Indic languages like Hindi.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview

**Stage 1**: Hate Speech Detection  
â†’ Binary classification (`Hate` vs `Non-Hate`) using CNN, BiLSTM, IndicBERT (full FT), and IndicBERT + Adapter.

**Stage 2**: Source Attribution  
â†’ Classify hate samples as `AI-generated` or `Human-authored` using a second adapter head.

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights

- 90.3% accuracy in source attribution using Adapter-based IndicBERT  
- Trained across 5 datasets: HASOC, OLID, HateXplain, ToxiGen, and RealToxicityPrompts  
- 67.7% fewer trainable parameters via adapter-tuning  
- Streamlit demo and result visualizations included
